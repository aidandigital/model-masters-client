      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

          What is JavaScript?

          Does disabling JavaScript protect me?
        </summary>
        Disabling JavaScript provides minimal security and major inconvenience. JavaScript is relatively safe because it is generally limited to the current web page and some information from the browser. JavaScript cannot access your files, camera, location, or microphone without your explicit permission. The biggest vulnerability comes from when developers don't properly filter user submitted content (XSS). You can use JavaScript safely by reviewing your browser's privacy settings, visiting only legitimate websites, and being extra careful what websites you enter sensitive information on.

          The focus of Model Masters is to allow users to publish and share their creations with eachother. When registering, users sign up as either a "fan" or a "member". Members can publish and view models, but fans can only view them. Fan accounts are great for family members or friends who don't make models themselves. Important users may be promoted to "model master" status by an admin. Anyone above member status can publish a model from their profile which you can access in the upper right corner. You can view anyone's models by visiting the "Garage" section in their profile, or you can view all models by visiting the "All Models" page.
